## Features

### Image handling

One of the core principles behind Intrepid is that your data must be portable. For a new, unsaved file, pasted or dropped images are embedded as Base64 encoded strings. When the file is saved, these images are extracted to an assets folder inside your file. From then on, all new images are added to the assets folder.
